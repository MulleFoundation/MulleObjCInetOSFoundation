// time the old enemy, what it is it ?
//
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time
// Assume the universe is a computer that has a tick rate called "planck time"
// A second is currently ~ 5*10^44 ticks.
//
// The second is defined as 9,192,631,770 periods of a certain frequency of
// radiation from the caesium atom: a so-called atomic clock. Lets's assume for
// our purposes that this is a coarse way to get at the ticks.
//
// This physical time is also known as "dynamical time" [Cal. Cals, Dershowitz,Rheingold]
//
// But a second is also one minute / 60. Where a minute is 1 hour / 60. Where
// 1 hour is 1 day / 24. And a day is midnight to midnight. And that duration
// does change because the earth wobbles and slows down, whereas the tickrate
// doesn't.
//
// This time is also known as "solar time" [Cal. Cals, Dershowitz,Rheingold]
//
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time
//
// Our clock time is based on UTC. To match up UTC with
// the ticks, occasionally there are leap seconds introduced. But UTC never
// really matches, it just approximates. The duration of a second is kept
// constant though.
//
// It could be easier, but then it's not.
//
// Assume someone counted all the seconds starting from 1.1.1970 midnight. That
// is the reference tick. It's physical time. To match things with the solar time
// the "International Telecommunications Union" may add or subtracts leap seconds
// at the end of each month(!). In reality there have been as of July 2015,
// 26 leap seconds in total, all positive.
//
// NSDate contains a NSTimeInterval. It's not per se UTC!
